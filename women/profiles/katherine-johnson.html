      <h1>Katherine Johnson</h1>
      <div class="meta">
        By Catarina Prado — Published on Dec 7, 2025

      <p>
        Katherine Johnson was a mathematician whose work at NASA became essential to the success of the early U.S. space program. 
        At a time when both racial and gender barriers were deeply embedded in science and engineering, her calculations helped send astronauts safely into space — and back to Earth.
      </p>

      <h2>Early life and passion for mathematics</h2>
      <p>
        Born in 1918 in West Virginia, Katherine Johnson showed extraordinary talent in mathematics from an early age. 
        She advanced quickly through school, graduating from college at just 18 years old with degrees in mathematics and French.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her love for numbers was not abstract — she saw mathematics as a practical language capable of describing motion, trajectories, and physical reality.
      </p>

      <h2>NASA and the space race</h2>
      <p>
        Katherine joined what was then the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), later NASA, as part of a group of women known as “human computers.”
        Her role was to calculate flight paths, orbital mechanics, and reentry trajectories with extreme precision.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the Mercury program, astronaut John Glenn famously requested that Katherine personally verify the computer-generated calculations for his orbital flight.
        He trusted her math over the machines — and she was right.
      </p>

      <h2>Impact on aerospace engineering</h2>
      <p>
        Katherine Johnson’s work contributed to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The first American human spaceflight</li>
        <li>The first American orbital mission</li>
        <li>The Apollo missions, including Apollo 11</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Her calculations combined Newtonian mechanics, analytical geometry, and an intuitive understanding of motion — skills that remain foundational in aerospace engineering today.
      </p>

      <h2>Why her legacy matters</h2>
      <p>
        Katherine Johnson proved that brilliance has no gender and no color.
        Her career reminds us that science advances fastest when talent is recognized and allowed to flourish.
      </p>

      <p>
        For girls interested in STEM, her story is a powerful reminder: mastering fundamentals, asking questions, and trusting your own reasoning can take you all the way to space.
