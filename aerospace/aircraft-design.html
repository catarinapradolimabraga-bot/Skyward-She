      <h1>Aircraft design — wings, stability & control surfaces</h1>
      <p class="meta">By Catarina Prado — Published on December 7, 2025</p>

      <p class="lead">
        Aircraft design is a delicate balance between aerodynamics, stability and mission performance. Every curve of a 
        wing, every adjustment in the tail, and every control surface contributes to how an aircraft flies, maneuvers 
        and remains stable across a wide range of speeds and atmospheric conditions.
      </p>

      <h2>1. The purpose of wings: more than generating lift</h2>
      <p>
        Wings generate lift, but they also define efficiency, stability and maneuverability. Their geometry shapes the 
        entire flight experience. Important characteristics include wing planform, aspect ratio and airfoil design.
      </p>

      <h3>Wing planform</h3>
      <p>
        The shape of the wing as viewed from above influences drag, maneuverability and stall behavior:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Straight wings</strong> — common in trainers and low-speed aircraft.</li>
        <li><strong>Swept wings</strong> — reduce drag at high speeds; ideal for jet airliners.</li>
        <li><strong>Delta wings</strong> — excellent at high angles of attack; common in supersonic aircraft.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Aspect ratio</h3>
      <p>
        High aspect ratio wings (long and slender) are extremely efficient, as seen in gliders. Low aspect ratio wings 
        (shorter and wider) provide agility and are often used in fighter jets.
      </p>

      <h3>Airfoil shape</h3>
      <p>
        The airfoil cross-section determines how lift is produced, the drag profile, stall behavior and performance at 
        various speeds.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Center of gravity & aerodynamic center</h2>
      <p>
        Aircraft stability depends on the relationship between the center of gravity (CG) and the aerodynamic center (AC). 
        For stable flight, the CG must lie ahead of the AC. If the CG shifts too far aft, the aircraft becomes unstable — 
        pitch disturbances grow instead of settling.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Control surfaces: how pilots command the aircraft</h2>

      <h3>Ailerons — roll control</h3>
      <p>Located at the outer trailing edge of the wings; they create differential lift to roll the aircraft.</p>

      <h3>Elevator — pitch control</h3>
      <p>Mounted on the horizontal stabilizer; it raises or lowers the nose of the aircraft.</p>

      <h3>Rudder — yaw control</h3>
      <p>Mounted on the vertical stabilizer; it controls directional movement and balances turns.</p>

      <h2>4. Stability: longitudinal, lateral and directional</h2>

      <h3>Longitudinal stability (pitch)</h3>
      <p>
        Determined by CG position, tail size and wing placement. A stable aircraft naturally returns to level flight after 
        a pitch disturbance.
      </p>

      <h3>Lateral stability (roll)</h3>
      <p>
        Influenced by wing dihedral, sweep angle and high-wing vs low-wing configuration.
      </p>

      <h3>Directional stability (yaw)</h3>
      <p>
        Provided by the vertical stabilizer, fuselage geometry and, in some cases, dorsal fins.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Wings and maneuverability</h2>
      <p>
        Designers balance stability and agility. Fighter jets often have relaxed static stability — intentionally unstable 
        designs stabilized by fly-by-wire computers — enabling rapid maneuverability.
      </p>

      <h2>6. High-lift devices: flaps, slats & spoilers</h2>

      <h3>Flaps</h3>
      <p>Increase wing camber and lift during takeoff and landing.</p>

      <h3>Slats</h3>
      <p>Delay stall by improving airflow at high angles of attack.</p>

      <h3>Spoilers</h3>
      <p>Reduce lift and increase drag, assisting in descent and braking.</p>

      <h2>7. Why modern aircraft look the way they do</h2>
      <p>
        Design reflects mission: airliners prioritize efficiency, fighters prioritize maneuverability, and gliders prioritize 
        low drag. Every aircraft is a compromise between performance, stability, safety and mission requirements.
