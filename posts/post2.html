    <h1>How I Started My Research Journey at 13</h1>
    <p><em>By Catarina</em></p>

    <p>Even though I’m only 13 — turning 14 on November 27 — my research journey has already started. I’ve always been curious, especially about aerospace engineering. I wanted to understand how rockets work, why aircraft can fly, and what makes space exploration possible. This curiosity became the beginning of my path in research.</p>

    <h2>Where Everything Started</h2>
    <p>I didn’t begin with formal research or a big project. I began with questions. Simple questions that grew into bigger ones. Questions about physics, space, satellites, and engineering. I realized that research isn’t about age — it's about wanting to learn, explore, and build answers.</p>

    <h2>Olympiads: My First Contact With Scientific Thinking</h2>
    <p>Science olympiads helped me discover that I loved solving complex problems. They taught me how to think logically, explain ideas, and stay calm under pressure. Each new olympiad pushed me to study more, understand patterns, and improve my reasoning.</p>
    <ul style="color:#6D7480; line-height:1.6;">
      <li>breaking problems into smaller steps,</li>
      <li>finding explanations based on evidence,</li>
      <li>and building confidence while learning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Doing My Own “Mini Research Projects”</h2>
    <p>I started creating small personal projects: studying flight mechanics, comparing rocket structures, analyzing space missions, and reading about aerospace design. These were simple projects, but they taught me how to think like a researcher — and that was the most important part.</p>

    <h2>Advice for Other Girls Starting Early</h2>
    <p>If you’re also young and beginning your research journey, here’s what I’ve learned:</p>
    <ul style="color:#6D7480; line-height:1.6;">
      <li>You don’t need to wait to get older — research begins with curiosity.</li>
      <li>Start with what you love; passion keeps you motivated.</li>
      <li>Use free resources online — the internet is your best lab.</li>
      <li>Practice explaining your ideas; communication is part of research.</li>
      <li>Document everything; this becomes your first research portfolio.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My dream is to become an aerospace engineer. Starting early helped me discover who I am and who I want to be. And if you're young and passionate too, believe me — you don’t have to wait to begin.</p>
