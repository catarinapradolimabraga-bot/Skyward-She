    <h1>How I Started My Research Journey at 13</h1>
    <p><em>By Catarina</em></p>

    <p>My research journey began earlier than most people expect. At 13, I was already deeply curious about how the world works — especially anything related to physics, space, and engineering. I didn’t have a lab or professional equipment, but I had something even more important: curiosity and the desire to learn.</p>

    <h2>Discovering My Passion</h2>
    <p>It all started with simple questions. Why do planes fly? How do satellites stay in orbit? Why are rockets shaped the way they are?</p>
    <p>Every question pushed me deeper into aerospace engineering. I realized how much research depends not on resources, but on asking <em>good questions</em> and being willing to explore.</p>

    <h2>Science Olympiads: My First “Research Steps”</h2>
    <p>Participating in olympiads was my first real contact with scientific thinking. They taught me how to analyze problems, think critically, and communicate solutions. Even without noticing, I was already practicing research skills:</p>
    <ul style="color:#6D7480; line-height:1.6;">
      <li>breaking questions into smaller steps,</li>
      <li>finding patterns,</li>
      <li>and building explanations based on evidence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Starting My Own Projects</h2>
    <p>I created small research-style projects on my own: analyzing flight mechanics, comparing rocket designs, and exploring the physics behind space travel. They weren’t “formal” projects, but they trained me to think like a researcher — and that was the whole point.</p>

    <h2>Advice for Other Girls Starting Young</h2>
    <p>If you're also beginning your research journey early, here are my best tips:</p>

    <ul style="color:#6D7480; line-height:1.6;">
      <li>Start with topics you love — passion makes everything easier.</li>
      <li>Don’t worry about having lab equipment.</li>
      <li>Ask lots of questions — research starts with curiosity.</li>
      <li>Use free resources online; the internet is your most powerful lab.</li>
      <li>Document everything — this becomes your first research portfolio.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Today, my dream is to become an aerospace engineer and inspire more girls to join STEM. Starting early made me confident, curious, and ready for bigger challenges.</p>
